<ol>
<li> Canvas the Area </li>
<p> Hang canvases painted with interior latex paint to brighten blank walls. Think big: The canvases should fill the wall. </p>

<li> Create A Side Table </li>
<p>Stack modular storage units (from $22, amazon.com) to make a stepped side table with surfaces for displays and lighting. Create miniature still lifes in the cubbies, or stack reading material that you’re going to get to...someday. </p>

  <li>Hang Plates</li>
 <p>lates in unexpected colors make a fresh wall arrangement. Vary hues (within a family), sizes, textures. Put the most dramatic plate toward the center (lay out the plates first to experiment); attach wire plate hangers and hang plates on picture nails.<p>
